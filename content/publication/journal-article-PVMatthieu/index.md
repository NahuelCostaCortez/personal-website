abstract: Photovoltaic systems are providing a growing share of power to the electric grid worldwide. To mitigate resource intermittency issues, new systems are increasingly being paired with battery energy storage for which ensuring long and safe operation is critical. Unlike more typical battery applications, these batteries will undergo sporadic usage which will prevent the application of traditional diagnosis methods. This work proposes a new methodology for opportunistic diagnosis using machine learning algorithms trained directly on photovoltaic battery charging data. The training was performed on synthetic voltage data under different degradations calculated from clear-sky model irradiance data. Validation was performed on synthetic voltage responses calculated from plane of array irradiance observations for a photovoltaic system located in Maui, HI, USA. An average RMSE of 2.75% was obtained for more than 10,000 different degradation paths with 25% or less degradation on the cells.
