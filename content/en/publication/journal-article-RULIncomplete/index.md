abstract: This study proposes a method for developing equipment lifespan estimators that combine physical information and numerical data, both of which may be incomplete. Physical information may not have a uniform fit to all experimental data, and health information may only be available at the initial and final periods. To address these issues, a procedure is defined to adjust the model to different subsets of available data, constrained by feasible trajectories in the health status space. Additionally, a new health model for rechargeable lithium batteries is proposed, and a use case is presented to demonstrate its efficacy. The optimistic (max–max) strategy is found to be the most suitable for diagnosing battery lifetime, based on the results.
