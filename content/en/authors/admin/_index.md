My research focuses on maximizing the potential of Machine Learning to anticipate potential outcomes and support decision-making in monitoring systems, particularly in scenarios with limited data. In the **biomedical field**, I have worked on problems such as <ins>arrhythmia</ins> detection and classification, analysis of <ins>X-ray</ins> images and <ins>functional PET</ins> images from patients in deep coma. In the **industrial domain**, my work has included monitoring and prognostics for <ins>lithium-ion batteries</ins>, <ins>aircraft engines</ins>, and <ins>industrial fans</ins>. I am particularly interested in developing models that are robust and effective, but also interpretable and easily accessible to non-ML/AI experts.

As an educator, I aim to convey my enthusiasm to students and provide them with the necessary tools to define and pursue their own goals. I also love to spread the word about my work and about AI in general. <ins>[Here](http://www.nahuelcosta.com/es/#talks) you can see past talks and courses</ins>.
 
üí¨  Feel free to reach out to me if you are interested in my research, looking for colaboration, or **<ins>are interested in some talks or training for your company/organization</ins>**.<br>
‚úâÔ∏è  You can shoot me a message at costanahuel@uniovi.es or any of my other social networks, I'll try to respond as soon as I can!
