abstract: NPCs (Non playable character) in a video game are characters that are part of the story, but cannot be directly controlled by the player. Thanks to advances in generative AI, game experiences will become progressively more immersive, realistic and personalized. In this activity students could learn how to design an NPC, give it facial emotions and connect it with a language model to give it some "intelligence".
