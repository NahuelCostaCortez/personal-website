abstract: Generative AIs have the ability to create new and original content. Their application has advanced exponentially in recent years and they have demonstrated great potential in a wide range of applications and in virtually every industry. The popularity of these models is on the rise, driven in large part by ChatGPT, and their impact is expected to grow in the coming years. As a result, the differences between people/companies that use them and those that don't will become increasingly noticeable. The aim of this practical workshop, organized in collaboration with Total Energies, was to introduce these technologies, to show how they can be used in a simple way, how to apply them to our day-to-day personal and work life and to understand how they can influence our lives in the near future. In this workshop we explored a wide variety of models with practical applications on different types of data and tasks to learn how these technologies can help us automate activities, be more efficient and productive. <br><br>[Web Total Energies](https://www.totalenergies.es/es/catedra-totalenergies-universidad-oviedo-talleres-inteligencia-artificial)<br>[Linkedin Total Energies](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7059513132439736320?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)
