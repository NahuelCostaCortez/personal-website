PhD in Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence researcher ü§ñ and university lecturer. I am currently working at the Metrology and Modeling Lab at the University of Oviedo. My research focuses on the development of AI models that allow the monitoring of systems with special interest in facilitating their access to non-experts. This has allowed me to work on diverse problems in different fields such as health, renewable energies, or the aeronautics industry. My goal is to make AI more transparent and accountable so that it can be used more effectively in decision-making. As an educator, I try to spread my enthusiasm to my students and give them the necessary tools to find and pursue their own goals.
 
üí¨  Feel free to reach out to me if you are interested in my research, looking for colaboration, or just for some interesting discussion.<br>
‚úâÔ∏è  You can shoot me a message at costanahuel@uniovi.es or any of my other social networks, I'll try to respond as soon as I can!
