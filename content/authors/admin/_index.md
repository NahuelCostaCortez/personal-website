I am a PhD candidate in the Metrology and Modeling Lab in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Oviedo. My research focus is on building explainable AI models for Prognosis & Health Management and decision-making. I am passionate about making machines learn ðŸ¤–, and my goal is to develop AI models that can provide insights into how they make decisions. Ultimately, I hope to make AI more transparent and accountable, so that it can be used more effectively and responsibly.
