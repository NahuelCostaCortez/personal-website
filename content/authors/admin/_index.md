As a PhD in computer science and researcher in artificial intelligence, I am passionate about making machines learn ðŸ¤–. I am currently working at the Metrology and Modeling Laboratory of the Department of Computer Science at the University of Oviedo, where I am also a professor. My research focus is on developing models that enable system monitoring with a focus on making AI models more easily understandable to non-experts, ensuring that they are accessible to a wider audience. My goal is to make AI more transparent and accountable so that it can be used more effectively and responsibly in decision-making. Additionally, as an educator, I aim to spread my enthusiasm to my students and give them the tools they need to find and pursue their own goals.
 
My current research interests are:
- Prognosis & Health Management
- Explainable AI
- Generative models (GANs, VAEs, Transformers, Difussion)
- Conformal prediction
