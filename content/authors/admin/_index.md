My research focuses on maximizing the potential of Machine Learning, particularly in scenarios with limited data, to anticipate potential outcomes and support decision-making in monitoring systems. This includes applications across both biomedical and industrial domains. In the **biomedical field**, I have worked on problems such as <ins>arrhythmia</ins> detection and classification, as well as the analysis of <ins>X-ray</ins> images and <ins>functional PET</ins> images from patients in deep coma. In the **industrial domain**, my work has included monitoring and prognostics for <ins>lithium-ion batteries</ins>, <ins>aircraft engines</ins>, and <ins>industrial fans</ins>. 

I have a particular interest in developing ML models that are robust and effective but also interpretable and accessible to non-experts, ensuring their practical utility across diverse applications. As an educator, I aim to convey my enthusiasm to students and provide them with the necessary tools to define and pursue their own goals.
